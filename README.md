With this code you can create a unique telegram bot, which will help you automate the process of any enterprise.
In our case, we have collected all the most useful information from the http://alatoo.edu.kg/ website and transferred it to the automated system of our telegram bot, you already can try it in http://t.me/AlaTooHelp_bot.

For a quick look at the code, here is a description of each file:

main.py - contains all the general code of the bot, such as interactions with the user.

markups.py - contains the structure of the pop-up buttons that the telegram bot outputs in subsequent interactions.

.pdf - several common pdf files with important program information or documents that the bot sends to the user's request.
